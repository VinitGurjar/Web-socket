# Web-socket-chatApp
## About
> A `Real Time` web based chat application. 

## Tech-stack
This project is a based on client-side and server-side real time chat connectivity, So for developing
the front-end `HTML` and `JavaScript` is uesd for creating the chat box and button also for onClickEvents
and for back-end I used `Node.js` to create a `http server` from scratch with some callbacks and also used
a WebSocket like `Socket.io`for real time chat.

## HowToUse
Run the html file on live server and open this app in two browser and then type a message on one browser and see the magic.
